# Aloeha_UI_Manager
UI manager for Aloeha. 

Aloeha is a thesis project currently being conducted by me and my groupmates. 
It uses a novel computer vision algorithm called Capsule Neural Networks to 
identify leaf rot and rust in Aloe Vera plants. The UI manager is responsible 
for loading the Aloe Vera input image and passes it to the Preprocessing 
manager then to the Capsnet Manager. It then collects the output of the Capsnet
manager and displays it to the user.

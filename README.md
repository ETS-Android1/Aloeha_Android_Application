# Aloeha_Android_Application
UI manager and Android Layer of Aloeha. 

Aloeha is a thesis project conducted by me and my groupmates. It uses a novel computer vision algorithm called Capsule Neural Networks to 
identify leaf rot and rust in Aloe Vera plants. The UI manager is responsible for loading the Aloe Vera input image and passes it to the Preprocessing 
manager then to the Capsnet Manager. It then collects the output of the Capsnet manager and displays it to the user.
